Hello there!
======

I am a graduate student at the [Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia, working on theoretical condensed matter physics. My research focuses on correlated materials, topological phases and their experimental signatures. [Here's](https://ttummuru.github.io/research/) a brief summary. Essentially, the job involves identifying systems that exhibit novel physical properties and demonstrating proof of concept. We employ mathematical tools, design and implement algorithms to efficiently simulate the models.

You can find my publications on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Tarun+Tummuru&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50&date-date_type=submitted_date) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=WG2IsFYAAAAJ).
