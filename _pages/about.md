Hello there!
======

I am a Scientist at Hitachi Energy Research.

Previously, I was a post-doc at the University of Zurich in the group of Titus Neupert. I had obtained a PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics from the [Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia. My research focuses on correlated materials, hyperbolic lattice models, topological phases and their experimental signatures. We identify systems with novel properties, construct models and then employ mathematical tools in conjunction with numerical algorithms to simulate the physics. In one line of work, for instance, we proposed structures that exhibit topological superconductivity at high temperatures. [Here's](https://ttummuru.github.io/research/) a brief summary.

You can find my publications on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Tarun+Tummuru&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50&date-date_type=submitted_date) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=WG2IsFYAAAAJ).
