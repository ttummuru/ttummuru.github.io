Hello there!
======

I am a graduate student at the [Blusson Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia, working on theoretical condensed matter physics.  My research focuses on correlated materials, topological phases of matter and their experimental signatures.

You can find my publications [here](https://ttummuru.github.io/research/) and on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Tarun+Tummuru&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50&date-date_type=submitted_date) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=WG2IsFYAAAAJ).
