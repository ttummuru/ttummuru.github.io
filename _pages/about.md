Hello there!
======

I am a graduate student at the [Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia, working on theoretical condensed matter physics. My research focuses on correlated materials, topological phases and their experimental signatures. We identify systems with novel properties, construct models and then employ mathematical tools in conjunction with numerical algorithms to simulate the physics. In one line of work, for instance, we proposed structures that exhibit topological superconductivity at high temperatures. [Here's](https://ttummuru.github.io/research/) a brief summary.

You can find my publications on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Tarun+Tummuru&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50&date-date_type=submitted_date) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=WG2IsFYAAAAJ).
